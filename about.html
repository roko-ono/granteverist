        About    </h1>

        <p>
            I'm a recent graduate of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where I studied economics and design with minors in statistics and business. 
           
            <!-- In fall 2022, I will (hopefully) begin a master's program in economics at the University of Oxford.
          
            I'm from Asheville, NC. I write things, few of which I share here, and read things, some aphorisms from which you can find here.
          
            I pass time with basketball, biking, chess, various instruments, and programming (front-end not included, evidently).
           
            I am on the far left in the photo below. I hope that does not disappoint. (Click to enlarge.) -->
