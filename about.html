                    My background is in data science and project management, which I’ve most recently been
                    applying to managing Caleb Rudow’s inaugural campaign for NC House District 116

                    degree in Economics and Design from UNC Chapel Hill. I’m currently based in my hometown
                    of Asheville, NC.

            <p>I have a strong appreciation for nature, technology, and economics. I find myself most interested in
                projects that bring these topics together: urban agriculture combines machine learning and robotics with
                sustainable agriculture, smart contracts combine mechanism design and governance structure with
                blockchain immutability, and prediction markets combine financial market design with politics and
                current events. Dozens of other solutions to climate change, economic inequality, and inefficient
                government continuously pique my interests.
            </p>
            <p>
                I contribute to projects like these by using data science to inform efficient and accurate decision
                making. My experience in data, economics, and design all tie back to a core curiosity about decision
                making, and this has led me to data science. “How can we design systems so that the easiest decision is
                also optimal?” must be predicated by answering “what outcomes are optimal?”
            </p>
            <p>
                We all have ideas of what optimal looks like, but there’s always truth in numbers. Finding that truth is
                the artful side of data science that I enjoy most.
