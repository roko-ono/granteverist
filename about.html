                <p>
                    I'm a recent graduate of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 
                    where I studied economics and design with minors in statistics and business. 
                    I'm from Asheville, NC, and I'm currently located in New York City.

    <div class="curve gray">
        <fieldset>
            <legend class="text_center">Interests</legend>
            <p>Alongside spending time with people and in nature, I enjoy learning about and exploring ideas 
                in economics, design, data science, agriculture, and technology.
            </p>
            <p>
                I see these interests reflected in what I do on a daily basisâ€”exploring questions using data 
                science, working with friends on projects, and doing my best to plants around my house alive.
                </p>

            <p>
                My interests have led me to collaborate with a variety of organizations, such as volunteering as a researcher for
                Dan Ariely's <a href="https://advanced-hindsight.com/" target="_blank">Center for Advanced Hindsight</a>, 
                <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Uyeq2Z2UHvKOtdOUCR2nnOwdp_7XqBqw-p27C1OO_Iw/edit?usp=sharing" 
                target="_blank">writing aritcles</a> for a DAO working to facilitate the allocation of grants 
                to public goods using quadratic funding, and working to chase down stolen bikes for a 
                micro-mobility startup in SF.
