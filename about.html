                    My focus is making systems of trust, power, and decision-making
                    more transparent, resilient and fair.

                    I'm currently working on this as a researcher and writer for

                    at UNC.

            <p>I have a strong appreciation for nature, technology, and economics. I'm most interested in
                projects that bring these fields together, including smart contracts, urban agriculture, prediction
                markets, and micromobility.
                <br>
                <br>
                Dozens of other solutions addressing economic inequality, climate change, and
                inefficient government continuously pique my interests.
                <br>
                <br>
                My interests all tie back to a core curiosity about decision
                making:
                <br>
                <br>
                How can we design the world so that the easiest decision is also the best?
