                <p>
                    I'm a recent graduate of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 
                    where I studied economics and design with minors in statistics and business. 
                    I'm from Asheville, NC, and I'm currently located in New York City.

        <fieldset>
            <legend class="text_center">Interests</legend>
            <p>Above all, I enjoy spending time with people and in nature. Alongside those activities, 
                I enjoy learning about and exploring ideas surrounding economics, design, data science, 
                agriculture, and technology.
            </p>
            <p>
                I see these interests reflected in what I do on a daily basisâ€”working on data science projects, 
                brainstorming with friends about startup ideas, and tending to plants.
                </p>

            <p>
                My interests have pushed me to be a part of several communities, from <a href="https://www.radicalxchange.org/" target="_blank">RadicalxChange</a>, 
                clr.fund, and the ethereum foundation.
                I find myself exploring web3, betting on prediction markets, working 
                alongside communities such as
