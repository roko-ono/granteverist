                    A lifelong interest in cultivation has led me in recent years to hydroponics,
                    the method of growing plants in water. This year, I led a team that earned an
                    $11,000 grant from the Renewable Energy Special Project Committee to build
                    a fully sustainable hydrogen fuel cell-powered hydroponics system.

                    scenarios which informed solutions for protecting customers and inventory.
                    This analysis helped bring our theft rates down from over 40% to under 12% and
                    guided the recovery of over $15,000 in hardware and over $3,000 in unpaid arrears.

                <p>In 2018, I cofounded Veera, a cold food storage solution that enhances the power
                    of evaporative cooling by controlling environmental conditions outside the unit.
                    The basic principles of evaporative cooling are based on the Zeer Pot, which has
                    existed for over 5000 years. The VeeraPot is composed of a highly convective inner
                    layer, a porous layer with high water capacity, and an outer layer that allows
                    evaporated water to escape.

            <p>
                To cool the enclosed space in the center, heat first
                strikes the unit's outer surface, raising its external temperature. As a result,
                the raised kinetic energy of the water medium increases evaporation near the
                surface.

                We designed a cold storage device that uses solar power to extend shelf life of

                bootstrapping efforts and received an initial 1000 unit commitment from the Bihar
                government. Conducted customer discovery interviews with over 100 small-holder
                farmers, distributors and families in rural Bihar, India. Negotiated a 40% subsidy
                from the Indian National Agriculture & Rural Development Bank for GIS enabled cold
